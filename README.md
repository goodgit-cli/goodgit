GoodGit is the brainchild of community frustrations – a chorus of developers who wanted Git to be friendlier. We listened. We coded. Now, we present to you GoodGit: Git, as it should be - intuitive, quick, and with a human touch.

## Features 🌟

- **Simplified Commands**: Because 'intuitive' is not just a buzzword.
- **AI-Powered Commit Messages**: Say goodbye to commit message writer's block.
- **SSH Setup in a Snap**: We value your time. Setting up SSH keys is now a breeze.
- **Multi-Account Flow**: Effortlessly juggle between work and personal Git accounts.
- **Effortless Search**: Zero in on that elusive commit or branch with ease.
- **Branching Simplified**: Focus on your work, not on stashing and managing branches.
- **Direct Publish**: Seamlessly push your projects to GitHub. No more context switching.   

   
### Upcoming Features 🚀

- **AI Merge Conflict Resolution**: Let AI handle the tough parts of merging.
- **GUI**: For when you want to point-and-click instead of type-and-peck.

   
## Prerequisites 🛠

- Python (We're talking code, not constrictors.)
- Pip (Python's package handler, not your childhood friend.)
- Internet Connection (It's the digital era, after all!)
- A Pair of Hands (Preferably attached to a human who can type.)
